# but there's no way to dynamically set an env variable for all container users.
# Many usages of this container are from docker exec task <x>, where no shell is invoked and the entrypoint is not run
# (entrypoint is only run on start, not on exec). Due to that, the following approaches do not work:
# - ~/.bashrc - only works for one user in a shell but we must support -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) which means the container could run as more than 1 user
# - /etc/profile or /etc/profile.d - only works for one user in a login shell
