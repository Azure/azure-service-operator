# Event Hubs Operator

## Resources supported

The Event Hubs operator can be used to provision the following resources.

1. Event Hubs - Deploys an Event Hubs instance given the Event Hubs namespace, Resource Group and Location. 
   1. [Sample YAML file](config/samples/azure_v1alpha1_eventhub.yaml)

2. Event Hubs namespace - Deploys an Event Hubs namespace given the resource group and location. Also has the ability to configure SKU, properties, and network rules.
   1. [Sample YAML file](config/samples/azure_v1alpha1_eventhub_namespace.yaml)

3. Consumer groups - Deploys a consumer group given the event hub, Event Hubs namespace and resource group. 
   1. [Sample YAML file](config/samples/azure_v1alpha1_capture.yaml)

### Event Hubs - Deployment output

The Event Hubs operator deploys an event hub in the specified namespace according to the spec.

As an output of deployment, the operator stores a JSON formatted secret with the following fields. For more details on where the secrets are stored, look [here](docs/howto/secrets.md).

- `primaryConnectionString`
- `secondaryConnectionString`
- `primaryKey`
- `secondaryKey`
- `sharedaccessKey`
- `eventhubNamespace`
- `eventhubName`
