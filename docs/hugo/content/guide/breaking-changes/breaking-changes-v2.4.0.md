## Beta CRD versions have been removed

**You cannot successfully upgrade to v2.4.0 until you have followed the migration steps below:**

1. If you have never installed a `beta` version of ASOv2, or used an `beta` version of a CRD, **no action is required**.
   If you're not sure, run the below steps anyway. They will not do anything if beta was never used.
2. Ensure the cluster is running the `v2.3.0` version of ASO.
3. Install the `v2.4.0` version of the `asoctl` tool by following the [installation instructions]( {{< relref "asoctl#installation" >}})
4. Run `asoctl clean crds`. This will migrate your resources to a newer version if needed and remove the `beta` CRD
   versions from the CRD `Status.StoredVersions` collection. For more details on this command see the
   [asoctl clean crds documentation]( {{< relref "asoctl#clean-crds" >}} )

Once you have successfully executed the above steps, you can upgrade to `v2.4.0`. 

When upgrading to `v2.4.0` the following error in the operator pod logs means that you need to run the above steps:
```
