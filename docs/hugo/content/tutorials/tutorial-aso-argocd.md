title: "Tutorial: Create ASO resources and view them in ArgoCD"
---

Follow the [guided example](https://azure-samples.github.io/aks-labs/docs/platform-engineering/aks-capz-aso/#sample-1-create-a-new-aks-cluster-as-an-argo-cd-application)
to see how you can deploy Argo CD on your cluster, deploy resources via ASO, and see the resources populated in the Argo CD UI.

You will learn hwo to declaratively provision a new AKS cluster using Argo CD and Helm, integrating them directly with Azure via the Azure Cluster API. Once you deploy resources on ASO, they will also show up in Argo CD.
