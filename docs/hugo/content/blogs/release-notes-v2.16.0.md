We're excited to announce the release of Azure Service Operator v2.16.0! This release comes with a host of improvements and fixes, along with support being added for some oft-requested resources. 

## üéâ New and improved resource support

### New resource support

We've added support for three new resources: 

- [Azure Compute Capacity Reservation Groups](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/pull/4980) allowing capacity reservation manifests to be declaratively included alongside VM manifests 
- [Managing Azure quotas](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/pull/4979) for Kubernetes native management of Azure quotas
- [NetworkWatchers/flowLogs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/issues/4614) for management of Network Security Group Flow Logs.

### Enhanced resource references

We've enhanced existing resource references with additional functionality:

- You can now specify Role Assignments using [well-known role defintion names](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/pull/4923) instead of GUIDs.
- UserAssignedIdentity now supports [config map](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/pull/4940).
- A system-managed identity can now be [specified in the app resources' identity references]((https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/pull/4924)).
- ResourceReferences now support [WellKnown names](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/pull/4922)

## üêõ Bug fixes

- Fixed a [high-priority regression](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/pull/4966) from ASO v2.15.0 where resources failed with the `"/v1, Kind=Secret is not cached"` error during resource claims.
- Kusto database creation should [no longer be attempted](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/pull/4976) while a cluster is stopped. 
- `NetcfgSubnetRangeOutsideVnet` error is [now retryable](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/pull/4931) for VirtualNetworksSubnet to avoid the resources becoming stuck in certain scenarios.
- Added a missing parameter for [default node pool](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/issues/4942) in Node Auto-Provisioning.
- Fixed [select annotation changed predicate](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/pull/4967) from mistakenly classifying creates as containing annotation changes.
- Fixed broken [ResourceReferenceProperties](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/pull/4925).
- Fixed `asoctl` import failures for [DataCollectionRule in PostgreSQL tables](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/issues/4919).
