To install the CRDs for these resources, your ASO configuration must include `kubernetesconfiguration.azure.com/*` as a one of the configured CRD patterns. See [CRD Management in ASO](https://azure.github.io/azure-service-operator/guide/crd-management/) for details on doing this for both [Helm](https://azure.github.io/azure-service-operator/guide/crd-management/#helm) and [YAML](https://azure.github.io/azure-service-operator/guide/crd-management/#yaml) based installations.

### Next Release

Development of these new resources is complete and they will be available in the next release of ASO.
