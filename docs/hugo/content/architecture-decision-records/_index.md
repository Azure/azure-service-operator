Each *architecture decision record* (ADR) documents one of the architecturally significant decisions we've made during the Azure Service Operator project.

Files are listed chronologically by month, and should contain the following sections:

* Context
* Decision
* Status
* Consequences
* Experience Report
* References

For background information, check out [this Cognitect blog entry](https://www.cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

ADR documents should be updated over time to keep them relevant, typically by updating the *Experience Report* section.
