# Architecture Decision Records

This folder documents some of the architecturally significant decisions we've made during the Azure Service Operator project.

Files are listed chronologically by month, and should contain the following sections:

* Context
* Decision
* Status
* Consequences
* Experience Report
* References

For background information, check out [this Cognitect blog entry](https://www.cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

ADR documents should be updated over time to keep them relevant.
