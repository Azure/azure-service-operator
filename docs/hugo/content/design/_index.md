description: "Design discussions, decisions, and specifications for Azure Service Operator v2"
---
Significant changes to Azure Service Operator should be captured by an ADR (architecture design record) in this folder. ADRs are listed reverse chronologically by year, and should contain the following sections:

* Context
* Decision
* Status
* Consequences
* Experience Report
* References

Ideally, each ADR should run to one or two pages in length.

For complex changes that require more detail, the ADR should provide an overview. Additional detail (say, to list alternative solutions, detail complex edge cases, or present detailed diagrams) should be captured in a separate design document linked from the ADR.

For background information, check out [this Cognitect blog entry](https://www.cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

ADR documents should be updated over time to keep them relevant, typically by updating the *Experience Report* section.

[**Package References**]({{< relref "ADR-2023-07-PackageReferences" >}}) - Consider the proposal for introducing a SubPackageReference in the Azure Service Operator code generator, discussing the implications for code that consumes PackageReference and the potential impact on namespace pollution and code organization.

[**Patch Collections**]({{< relref "ADR-2023-04-Patch-Collections" >}}) - Address the issue of resource drift in Azure Service Operator due to Azure Resource Providers' PATCH-like behavior on PUT, and discuss potential solutions such as optional properties and explicit nulls to ensure the custom resource represents the complete desired state.

[**Post-Reconciliation Extensions**]({{< relref "ADR-2023-03-Post-Reconciliation-Extension" >}}) - Understand the introduction of the PostReconciliationChecker extension in Azure Service Operator to handle post-reconciliation operations, allowing for custom conditions to be set on resources based on the status received from Azure Resource Manager.

[**Skipping Properties**]({{< relref "ADR-2023-09-Skipping-Properties" >}}) - A design to address the problems that occur when a property skips multiple resource versions and has a different shape when it returns.

## 2022

[**Backward Compatibility**]({{< relref "ADR-2022-02-Backward-Compatibility" >}}) - As a part of planning for our first beta release consider the implications of modifying the version prefix for code-generated resources in Azure Service Operator.

[**Change Detection**]({{< relref "ADR-2022-11-Change-Detection" >}}) - the challenges of change detection in Azure Service Operator, discussing the limitations of relying on Azure Resource Manager for goal state comparison, the impact of ARM throttling, and a proposal for ASO to perform its own goal state comparison to mitigate these issues.

[**Evil Discriminator**]({{< relref "ADR-2022-08-Evil-Discriminator" >}}) - Understand the challenges posed by the 'evil discriminator' in Swagger/OpenAPI, a term coined by the Azure Service Operator team to describe the differences in defining polymorphic API payloads in Swagger compared to JSON Schema.

[**Muliple Credential Operator**]({{< relref "ADR-2022-09-Multiple-Credential-Operator" >}}) - proposed support for multiple credentials under a global operator in Azure Service Operator, enabling management of Azure resources across multiple subscriptions, with a detailed explanation of the credential selection hierarchy and caching mechanism.

[**Reading Status properties from other ASO resources**]({{< relref "ADR-2022-09-Reading-Status-Properties-Of-Resources" >}}) - discussion of various ways to allow one ASO resource to consume information generated by another, with details on how we decided to use configmaps to do this.

[**Reconciler Extensions**]({{< relref "ADR-2022-01-Reconciler-Extensions" >}}) - Understand the need for reconciler extensions in Azure Service Operator to manage inconsistencies in Azure Resource Providers' behavior, and the proposal for precise, per-resource customization without duplicating existing functionality or risking inconsistencies.

[**Resource Import**]({{< relref "ADR-2022-11-Resource-Import" >}}) - Review the strategies for migrating from Azure Service Operator v1 to v2, including version integration and resource import job, each with its pros, cons, and potential blockers.

[**Reconciliation Extensions**]({{< relref "ADR-2022-12-Reconciliation-Extensions" >}}) - Understand the need for reconciliation extensions in Azure Service Operator to handle resources in transient states that preclude successful PUT operations, and the proposal for an extension point to modify the reconciliation flow accordingly.
