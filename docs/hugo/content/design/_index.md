Significant changes to Azure Service Operator should be captured by an ADR (architecture design record) in this folder. ADRs are listed chronologically by month, and should contain the following sections:

* Context
* Decision
* Status
* Consequences
* Experience Report
* References

Ideally, each ADR should run to one or two pages in length; if more detail is necessary, create a separate design document in this folder and link it from the ADR.

For background information, check out [this Cognitect blog entry](https://www.cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

ADR documents should be updated over time to keep them relevant, typically by updating the *Experience Report* section.
