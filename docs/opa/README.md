# Open Policy Agent (Gatekeeper)

Azure Service Operator defines a number of CDRs. OPA policies can be used to define constraints and policies for the different objects being provisioned.  
For example you may want to limit the locations of the resources being created by ASO, this example is available in this repository with both the [template](./aso_allowed_locations-template.yaml) and the [constraint](./aso_allowed_locations-template.yaml)
