# Issue Triage

On a regular basis (target: weekly) the development team will triage issues matching the following [GitHub search](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+-label%3Atriaged+no%3Amilestone+):

```
is:issue is:open -label:triaged no:milestone 
```

As issues are triaged, the label `triaged` will be added, along with a comment where appropriate.
