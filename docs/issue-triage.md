# Issue Triage

On a regular basis (target: weekly) the development team will triage issues matching the following [GitHub search](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aneeds-triage+):

```
is:issue is:open label:needs-triage
```

When new issues are created, our bot will automatically add the `needs-triage` tag so they show up in this list.
