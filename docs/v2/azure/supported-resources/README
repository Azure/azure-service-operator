This folder contains documentation fragments for injection into reports listing the versions of supported resources.

File names must match one of the following conventions. Extra files will result in an error from the generator.

`<group>.md` - Additional information to show for the entire group. This will be injected after the heading for the group, and before the list of resources.

`<group>-prerelease.md` - Shown before the list of unreleased resources for that group. If not found, `prerelease.md` will be used instead.

`<group>-released.md` - Shown before the list of released resources for that group. If not found, `released.md` will be used instead.

`<group>-deprecated.md` - Shown before the list of deprecated resources for that group. If not found, `deprecated.md` will be used instead.
