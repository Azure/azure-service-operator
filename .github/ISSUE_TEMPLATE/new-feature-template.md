_Describe the feature request._

<!--
If you want a new resource (or a new version of an existing resource), please provide a link to the ARM documentation for the resource type.

Tip: Including the search terms `Azure` `ARM` and `Bicep` can help you find the right documentation quickly.

E.g.  A Google search for `azure arm bicep storage queue` returns the following link as the first result:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.storage/storageaccounts/queueservices/queues?pivots=deployment-language-arm-template

If you'd like to bypass our prioritization process and implement a new resource yourself, check out our contribution guide [Adding a new code-generated resource](https://azure.github.io/azure-service-operator/contributing/add-a-new-code-generated-resource/). In most cases a new contributor can implement a new resource in a couple of days - and we're here to help you.
