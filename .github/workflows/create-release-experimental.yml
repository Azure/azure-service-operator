            This is an experimental release which containing the most recent commits from the main branch as of commit: ${{ github.sha }}.

            **This release might not be stable. Use at your own risk.**

            > ⚠️ The provided YAML manifest does not configure any CRDs to install by default, but is required.
            > You must specify the CRDs that you want to use as part of `crdPattern`, for example `'resources.azure.com/*;containerservice.azure.com/*;keyvault.azure.com/*;managedidentity.azure.com/*;apimanagement.azure.com/*'`.
            
            The recommended way to supply `crdPattern` is using [asoctl template](https://azure.github.io/azure-service-operator/tools/asoctl/#template):
            ```bash
            asoctl export template --source https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/releases/download/experimental/azureserviceoperator_experimental.yaml --crd-pattern "<pattern>" | kubectl apply -f -
            ```

            This release is only intended for developers wishing to try out the latest features, some of which may not be fully implemented.
            
            It is not recommended to run the experimental release for a long period of time, as the docker image referenced by the deployment is 
            `mcr.microsoft.com/k8s/azureserviceoperator:experimental`, which is always being updated. Test what you want to test and then uninstall the operator. 
            Running the operator for long periods of time on the `experimental` tag is not supported and will likely cause problems eventually.
