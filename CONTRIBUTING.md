# Contributing Guidelines

The Azure Service Operator project accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines the process to help get your contribution accepted.

Please see also the [Azure Service Operator Developer Guide](docs/community/developer-guide.md).

## Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a
couple of legal hurdles.

The [Microsoft CLA](https://cla.microsoft.com/) must be signed by all contributors. Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Once you are CLA'ed, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.

***NOTE***: Only original source code from you and other people that have
signed the CLA can be accepted into the repository.

## Support Channels

This is an open source project and as such no formal support is available. However, like all good open source projects, we do offer "best effort" support through GitHub issues.

GitHub issues can be filed here - https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/issues

Before opening a new issue or submitting a new pull request, it's helpful to search the project - it's likely that another user has already reported the issue you're facing, or it's a known issue that we're already aware of.

## Issues

Issues are used as the primary method for tracking anything to do with the Azure Service Operator project.

### Issue Lifecycle

The issue lifecycle is mainly driven by the core maintainers, but is good information for those contributing to the project. All issue types follow the same general lifecycle. Differences are noted below.
1. Issue creation
2. Triage
    - The maintainer in charge of triaging will apply the proper labels for the issue. This includes labels for priority, type, and metadata. If additional
    labels are needed in the future, we will add them.
    - (If needed) Clean up the title to succinctly and clearly state the issue. Also ensure that proposals are prefaced with "Proposal".
3. Discussion
    - "Feature" and "Bug" issues should be connected to the PR that resolves it.
    - Whoever is working on a "Feature" or "Bug" issue (whether a maintainer or someone from the community), should either assign the issue to themself or make a comment in the issue saying that they are taking it.
    - "Proposal" and "Question" issues should stay open until resolved or if they have not been active for more than 30 days. This will help keep the issue queue to a manageable size and reduce noise. Should the issue need to stay open, the `keep open` label can be added.
4. Issue closure

## How to Contribute a Patch

1. If you haven't already done so, sign a Contributor License Agreement (see details above).
2. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
3. Submit a pull request.

## Reporting Security Issues
