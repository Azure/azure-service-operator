# Contributing Guidelines

The Azure Service Operator project accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines the process to help get your contribution accepted.

## Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a
couple of legal hurdles.

The [Microsoft CLA](https://cla.microsoft.com/) must be signed by all contributors. Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Once you are CLA'ed, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.

***NOTE***: Only original source code from you and other people that have signed the CLA can be accepted into the repository.

## How to Contribute a Patch

1. If you haven't already done so, sign a Contributor License Agreement (see details above).
2. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
3. Submit a pull request.
