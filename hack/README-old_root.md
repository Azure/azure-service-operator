# Azure K8s Infra (Experimental)
Kubernetes-native infrastructure provider for Azure at scale

## What is Azure K8s Infra?
Azure K8s Infra is a Kubernetes controller, API, and Custom Resource Definition (CRD) code generator, 
which enables K8s users to build any Azure resource.

### What makes K8s Infra different?
- **K8s Native:** we provide strong structured schema and Golang API structures
- **Azure Native:** our CRDs understand Azure resource lifecycle and model it using K8s garbage collection via ownership references
- **Cloud Scale:** we generate K8s CRDs from Azure Resource Manager schemas to move as fast as Azure
- **Async Reconciliation:** we don't block on resource creation

## Project Status
This project is experimental and is not supported.

### Project Goals
- Create a scalable process for exposing Azure resources natively in Kubernetes
- Provide a prototype infrastructure reconciler for [Cluster API Provider Azure](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-azure)
- Be a research and development space for improving Azure user experience in Kubernetes

### Project Non-Goals
- Long term support

## Getting Started
To get started you are going to need a cluster to deploy `azure-service-operator`. You can use any 1.16.0+ K8s 
cluster. To get going quicker, just spin up a local cluster using [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io).

To get started using the Azure `azure-service-operator` infrastructure provider, visit our [releases](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/releases),
and follow the instructions for the latest release.

Once the controller has been installed in your cluster, you should be able to run the following:
```bash
$ k get pod -A
NAMESPACE              NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
azureoperator-system   aso-controller-manager-b98bc664-6h6sv   2/2     Running   0          7m15s

# check out the logs for the running controller
$ k logs pod/aso-controller-manager-b98bc664-6h6sv -n azureoperator-system -c manager

# let's create an Azure ResourceGroup in westus2 with the name "foo-2019"
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -

kind: ResourceGroup

```

For samples of additional resources, see the [resource samples directory in the repo](https://github.com/Azure/k8s-infra/tree/master/config/samples).
We currently provide only a subset of resources. As work on the [code generator](https://github.com/Azure/k8s-infra/tree/master/hack/generator)
progresses, the resources provided will expand considerably.

### Tearing it down
**Warning: if you `kubectl delete` an Azure resource, it will delete the Azure resource. This can
be dangerous if you were to do this with an existing resource group which contains resources you do
not wish to be deleted.**

If you want to delete the resources you've created, just `kubectl delete` each of the Azure 
resources.

As for deleting controller components, just `kubectl delete -f` the release manifests you created 
to get started. For example, creating and deleting cert-manager.
```bash
# apply the cert-manager components
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.13.0/cert-manager.yaml

# remove the cert-manager components
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.13.0/cert-manager.yaml
```
