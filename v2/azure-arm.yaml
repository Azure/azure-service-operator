# Exclusions for packages that currently produce types including AnyType.

anyTypePackages:


# 
# Type Transformers are used to make precision edits to the object model we've loaded from the 
# original OpenAPI/Swagger files.
#
# We need these because there is great variability in how different product groups define their 
# APIs, and because some of the common constructs that are used can't be directly handled in Go.
#
# The available properties fall into two groups - the first used to select which type needs to be 
# transformed, and the second to define the required transformation.
#
# Selection Properties
#
# group    - select types or properties in the specified group or groups
# version  - select types or properties in the specified version or version(s)
# name     - select types or properties with the specified name or name(s)
# property - select properties with the given name or name(s)
#
# All of these properties are matchers:
#
# o They allow multiple values, semicolon (;) separated
# o They allow glob style wildcards '*' and '?'
#
# ifType - matches a type or property only if it has the specified type
#
# target - defines a new type to replace the existing
# remove - specifies a property should be deleted
#
# Every TypeTransformer has a 'because' property which should be used to explain (in human terms)
# what's being done and why.
#
# Some of the transformations below have been commented to illustrate use.
#
typeTransformers:
  # 
  # Match the property 'Tags' on any type,
  # but only if it has the type 'map[string]any'
  # and replace it with 'map[string]string'
  #

# 
# This section of the configuration file mirrors the hierarchy of generated types, providing 
# additional information about how to handle each one.
#
# Each level of the configuration works as follows:
#
# group:              // The service - e.g. batch, redis or storage
#   version:          // ARM API version - e.g. 2020-12-01
#     type:           // A resource or subtype (similar to kubernetes 'kind')
#       property:     // An attribute found on an object type
#
# Please add new elements to this configuration in ALPHABETICAL order to make 
# it easier for future maintainers to scan for the item they want.
# 
# At specific levels, optional modifiers may be injected.
# All modifiers start with `$` in order to avoid clashes with ARM object and 
# property names
#
# ===================
#   Group modifiers
# ===================
#
# $payloadType: <string>
#     Specifies the type of the payload to generate for the group. This is used to compensate for 
#     some Azure Resource Providers using PATCH semantics instead of PUT semantics for updates.
#     We control this at the group level because RPs tend to be consistent across all their resources.
#
#     Valid values are:
#     omitempty - only non-empty properties are included (default)
#     explicitCollections - always include collections (serialized as null), even if empty; other properties only if specified.
#     explicitEmptyCollections - always include collections (serialized as empty collections), even if empty; other properties only if specified.
#     explicitProperties - always include all properties, even the empty ones.
#
# ==================
#   Type modifiers
# ==================
#
# $azureGeneratedSecrets: <array of strings>
#     An array of names identifying the secrets generated by Azure which can be automatically
#     downloaded by the operator. Each element in the collection becomes
#     a property on operatorSpec.Secrets. Actual retrieval of the secrets must be manually
#     implemented as an extension on the resource type in question.
#     Only valid for resource types.
#
# $generatedConfigs: <map of string -> string>
#     The key of the map is the name of the property to export, the value of the map is a json-path like expression
#     to the property to export. Currently only $.<prop>.<prop> syntax is supported.
#     Only valid for resources.
#     Example:
#         $generatedConfigs:
#           BlobEndpoint: $.Status.PrimaryEndpoints.Blob
#
# $export: <bool>
#     Requests that support for this resource type be generated.
#     Automatically includes all other types required for this resource
#     If not specified, the default value is false.
#     Only valid for resource types.
#
# $exportAs: <string>
#     Requests that this resource type be exported with the specified
#     identifier, allowing poorly named types to be renamed.
#     Implies $export: true
#     Only valid for resource types.
#
# $importable: <bool>
#     Requests that support for asoctl to import this resource type be included
#     in the generated code.
#     If not specified, the default value is true.
#     Only valid for resource types.
#
# $manualConfigs: <array of strings>
#     An array of names identifying the properties which will be exported to config maps manually. Prefer $generatedConfigs
#     if the property is on Status or otherwise accessible on the resource itself. $manualConfigs can be used
#     to have more control over exactly what value goes into the exported config map, at the cost of needing to manually implement
#     the config map export in a resource extension. BEWARE: If you include a property here but don't actually use it in
#     a manually implemented resource extension, the $.Spec.OperatorSpec.ConfigMaps.<MyCustomConfigValue> field will do nothing
#     and be ignored!
#     Example:
#         $manualConfigs:
#           - MyCustomConfigValue
#
# $nameInNextVersion: <string>
#     Gives the name this type has in the next version of the resource.
#     Establishes a connection between the two types allowing for proper
#     forward and backward conversion.
#
# $renameTo: <string>
#     Changes the name of any type, allowing selective adjustments to make 
#     names more idiomatic for Go and/or Kubernetes use.
#
#     For resource types, prefer $exportAs
#     Note: using $export: + $renameTo: for a resource is not quite the same as
#     using $exportAs because the renaming happens at a different stage of the
#     pipeline.
#
#     If you have two names differing only by letter case, use a TypeTransform
#     to selectively rename one of the types.
#
# $supportedFrom: <version>
#     Gives the version number of the first release of ASO that provides 
#     support for this resource.
#     Note: If the resource is renamed via $exportAs, $supportedFrom won't 
#     work if you put it in the same section as $exportAs; you instead need 
#     to place $supportedFrom in a section using the name specified by $exportAs
#
# $isResource: <bool>
#     Configures if the given type is a resource or not. This can be used to
#     mark types that are labelled as a resources in the Swagger as normal (non-resource) types.
#     This is needed especially for compute and networking groups whose SubResource incorrectly labels
#     many resource references as resources instead.
#
# $resourceEmbeddedInParent: <resource name>
#     Labels the given type as a resource in some contexts, while not in others.
#     In particular this caters to pseudo-resources which have ARM IDs associated with them
#     and have GET APIs but cannot be created except as part of their parent. This enables
#     the generator to prune these resources from all contexts except their creation context.
#     A concrete example of this can be seen on LoadBalancer with "resources" like LoadBalancingRule.
#
# =======================
#   Property modifiers
# =======================
#
# $armReference: <bool>
#     Indicates whether this property is an ARM reference to another resource. 
#     Set to 'true' to confirm the property is an ARM reference.
#     Set to 'false' to disable our heuristics if a property is incorrectly 
#     identified as an ARM reference.
#
# $importConfigMapMode: <optional|required>
#     Specifies that the property can be imported from a config map.
#     Optional: The property may be specified as string or imported from a config map.
#               To achieve this in a non-breaking way, a new property is added to the object living alongside
#               the existing property. The new property is called <propName>FromConfig.
#     Required: The property must be specified from a config map, it cannot be given as a raw string.
#
# $isSecret: <bool>
#     Specifies that the property references a secret
#     Secrets are string values read from a secure storage by ASO when needed.
#     Set to `true` to flag this property as a secret. This is an override for when the Swagger
#     is incomplete. If you specify $isSecret: true, you should also open a PR to update the 
#     upstream Swagger repo spec with the x-ms-secret annotation.
#     Here's a reference PR: https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/19399
#
# $nameInNextVersion: <string>
#     Gives the name this property has in the next version of the resource
#     Establishes a connection between the two properties allowing for proper
#     forward and backward conversion.
#
# $resourceLifecycleOwnedByParent: <string>
#     Specifies that the property references a misbehaving embedded resource, one whose parent
#     resource owns the lifecycle of the child resource.
#     These resources are embedded resources which are overwritten when their parent resource
#     is changed. For example see https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/issues/1944.
#     The value should be the name of the parent resource which owns the lifecycle of the
#     sub-resource.
#
# $renameTo: <string>
#     Changes the name of the property.
#
#     The name in the serialized ARM payload does NOT change. This only changes the name of the property
#     in the ASO types. The shape serialized to ARM uses the original name.
