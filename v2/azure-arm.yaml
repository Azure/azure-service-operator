# These filters are used early in the processing pipeline. 
#
# We exclude types with known problems, types that we don't need, and other types that may cause issues.
# The 'because' value for each filter describes the reason why the filter is present.
#
# Filters are applied in document order, with the earliest matching filter being applied for each type.

# 
# This section of the configuration file mirrors the hierarchy of generated types, providing 
# additional information about how to handle each one.
#
# Each level of the configuration works as follows:
#
# group:              // The service - e.g. batch, redis or storage
#   version:          // ARM API version - e.g. 2020-12-01
#     type:           // A resource or subtype (similar to kubernetes 'kind')
#       property:     // An attribute found on an object type
#
# Please add new elements to this configuration in ALPHABETICAL order to make 
# it easier for future maintainers to scan for the item they want.
# 
# At specific levels, optional modifiers may be injected.
# All modifiers start with `$` in order to avoid clashes with ARM object and 
# property names
#
# Available 'type' modifiers:
#
# $export: <bool>
#     Requests that support for this resource type be generated.
#     Automatically includes all other types required for this resource
#     If not specified, the default value is false.
#     Only valid for resource types.
#
# $exportAs: <string>
#     Requests that this resource type be exported with the specified
#     identifier, allowing poorly named types to be renamed.
#     Implies $export: true
#     Only valid for resource types.
#
# $nameInNextVersion: <string>
#     Gives the name this type has in the next version of the resource.
#     Establishes a connection between the two types allowing for proper
#     forward and backward conversion.
#
# Available 'property' modifiers:
#
# $armReference: <bool>
#     Indicates whether this property is an ARM reference to another resource. 
#     Set to 'true' to confirm the property is an ARM reference.
#     Set to 'false' to disable our heuristics if a property is incorrectly 
#     identified as an ARM reference.
#
# $isSecret: <bool>
#     Specifies that the property references a secret.
#     Set to `true` to flag this property as a secret. Secrets are string values 
#     read from a secure storage by ASO when needed.
#
# $nameInNextVersion: <string>
#     Gives the name this property has in the next version of the resource
#     Establishes a connection between the two properties allowing for proper
#     forward and backward conversion.
