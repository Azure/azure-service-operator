  introduction: |
    These are the resources with Azure Service Operator support committed to our **main** branch
    grouped by the originating ARM service.
    (Newly supported resources will appear in this list prior to inclusion in any ASO release.)
  # resourceUrlTemplate is the template for generating URLs to the API docs for our resources
  # the placeholders {group} {version} and {kind} are supported.
  resourceUrlTemplate: "https://azure.github.io/azure-service-operator/reference/{group}/{version}/#{group}.azure.com/{version}.{kind}"
  # resourcePath is a template used for generating a file path for checking whether docs for a resource have been generated
  # specified relative to the directory of outputPath, and supports the same placeholders
  resourcePathTemplate: "{group}/{version}.md"

#
# These filters are used early in the processing pipeline. 
#
# We exclude types with known problems, types that we don't need, and other types that may cause issues.
# The 'because' value for each filter describes the reason why the filter is present.
#
# Filters are applied in document order, with the earliest matching filter being applied for each type.

# 
# This section of the configuration file mirrors the hierarchy of generated types, providing 
# additional information about how to handle each one.
#
# Each level of the configuration works as follows:
#
# group:              // The service - e.g. batch, redis or storage
#   version:          // ARM API version - e.g. 2020-12-01
#     type:           // A resource or subtype (similar to kubernetes 'kind')
#       property:     // An attribute found on an object type
#
# Please add new elements to this configuration in ALPHABETICAL order to make 
# it easier for future maintainers to scan for the item they want.
# 
# At specific levels, optional modifiers may be injected.
# All modifiers start with `$` in order to avoid clashes with ARM object and 
# property names
#
# Available 'type' modifiers:
#
# $azureGeneratedSecrets: <array of strings>
#     An array of names identifying the secrets generated by Azure which can be automatically
#     downloaded by the operator. Each element in the collection becomes
#     a property on operatorSpec.Secrets. Actual retrieval of the secrets must be manually
#     implemented as an extension on the resource type in question.
#     Only valid for resource types.
#
# $export: <bool>
#     Requests that support for this resource type be generated.
#     Automatically includes all other types required for this resource
#     If not specified, the default value is false.
#     Only valid for resource types.
#
# $exportAs: <string>
#     Requests that this resource type be exported with the specified
#     identifier, allowing poorly named types to be renamed.
#     Implies $export: true
#     Only valid for resource types.
#
# $nameInNextVersion: <string>
#     Gives the name this type has in the next version of the resource.
#     Establishes a connection between the two types allowing for proper
#     forward and backward conversion.
#
# $supportedFrom: <version>
#     Gives the version number of the first release of ASO that provides 
#     support for this resource.
#     Note: If the resource is renamed via $exportAs, $supportedFrom won't 
#     work if you put it in the same section as $exportAs; you instead need 
#     to place $supportedFrom in a section using the name specified by $exportAs
#
# $isResource: <bool>
#     Configures if the given type is a resource or not. This can be used to
#     mark types that are labelled as a resources in the Swagger as normal (non-resource) types.
#     This is needed especially for compute and networking groups whose SubResource incorrectly labels
#     many resource references as resources instead.
#
# $resourceEmbeddedInParent: <resource name>
#     Labels the given type as a resource in some contexts, while not in others.
#     In particular this caters to pseudo-resources which have ARM IDs associated with them
#     and have GET APIs but cannot be created except as part of their parent. This enables
#     the generator to prune these resources from all contexts except their creation context.
#     A concrete example of this can be seen on LoadBalancer with "resources" like LoadBalancingRule.
#
# Available 'property' modifiers:
#
# $armReference: <bool>
#     Indicates whether this property is an ARM reference to another resource. 
#     Set to 'true' to confirm the property is an ARM reference.
#     Set to 'false' to disable our heuristics if a property is incorrectly 
#     identified as an ARM reference.
#
# $isSecret: <bool>
#     Specifies that the property references a secret
#     Secrets are string values read from a secure storage by ASO when needed.
#     Set to `true` to flag this property as a secret. This is an override for when the Swagger
#     is incomplete. If you specify $isSecret: true, you should also open a PR to update the 
#     upstream Swagger repo spec with the x-ms-secret annotation.
#     Here's a reference PR: https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/19399
#
# $nameInNextVersion: <string>
#     Gives the name this property has in the next version of the resource
#     Establishes a connection between the two properties allowing for proper
#     forward and backward conversion.
#
# $resourceLifecycleOwnedByParent: <string>
#     Specifies that the property references a misbehaving embedded resource, one whose parent
#     resource owns the lifecycle of the child resource.
#     These resources are embedded resources which are overwritten when their parent resource
#     is changed. For example see https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/issues/1944.
#     The value should be the name of the parent resource which owns the lifecycle of the
#     sub-resource.
