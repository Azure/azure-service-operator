// PreReconciliationChecker is implemented by resources that want to do extra checks before proceeding with
// a full ARM reconcile. This extension is invoked before sending any requests to Azure, giving resources
// the ability to block reconciliation until prerequisites are met.
// Implement this extension when:
// - Parent/owner resources must reach certain states before child creation
// - External dependencies must be satisfied before reconciling
// - Reconciliation would fail due to known prerequisites not being met

	// ARM resources should implement this to avoid reconciliation attempts that cannot possibly succeed.
	// Returns ProceedWithReconcile if the reconciliation should go ahead.
	// Returns BlockReconcile and a human-readable reason if the reconciliation should be skipped.
	// ctx is the current operation context.
	// obj is the resource about to be reconciled. The resource's status will be freshly updated.
	// owner is the owner of the resource about to be reconciled. The owner's status will be freshly updated. May be nil
	// if the resource has no owner, or if it has been referenced via ARMID directly.
	// resourceResolver helps resolve resource references.
	// armClient allows access to ARM for any required queries.
	// log is the logger for the current operation.
	// next is the next (nested) implementation to call.
