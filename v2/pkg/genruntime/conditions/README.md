# conditions

## Overview

The conditions package provides a comprehensive framework for managing and tracking the state of Azure Service Operator resources through standardized condition objects. It implements the Kubernetes-style conditions pattern, allowing resources to report their current state, any errors, and relevant metadata in a consistent way.

**Condition management**: This package offers utilities for creating, updating, and querying conditions that represent the state of resources. Conditions have a well-defined structure with types, status (True/False/Unknown), severity levels, reasons, and messages.

**Ready condition**: The package provides specialized support for the Ready condition, which indicates whether a resource has been successfully provisioned and can be used, with clear semantics for interpreting different status values and severity levels.

**Error handling**: Includes specialized error types like `ReadyConditionImpactingError` that integrate with the condition system, making it easy to create conditions from errors encountered during reconciliation.

**Reason-aware condition handling**: Implements sophisticated condition update logic that understands the relative importance of different reasons for conditions, ensuring the most relevant conditions are preserved when multiple systems are updating a resource's state.

## Testing

The package uses standard Go testing with:

* Gomega for assertions to verify condition behavior
* Clock mocking for time-dependent tests
* Comprehensive test cases covering condition equivalence, priority, and transition behavior

Tests can be run using:

```bash
go test ./v2/pkg/genruntime/conditions/...
```
