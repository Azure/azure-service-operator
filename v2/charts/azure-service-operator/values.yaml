# MaxConcurrentReconciles is the number of threads/goroutines dedicated to reconciling each resource type.

# IMPORTANT: Having MaxConcurrentReconciles set to N does not mean that ASO is limited to N interactions with
# Azure at any given time, because the control loop yields to another resource while it is not actively issuing HTTP
# calls to Azure. Any single resource only blocks the control-loop for its resource-type for as long as it takes to issue
# an HTTP call to Azure, view the result, and make a decision. In most cases the time taken to perform these actions
# (and thus how long the loop is blocked and preventing other resources from being acted upon) is a few hundred
# milliseconds to at most a second or two. In a typical 60s period, many hundreds or even thousands of resources
# can be managed with this set to 1.

rateLimit:
  # mode configures the internal rate-limiting mode.
  # Valid values are [disabled, bucket]
  # * disabled: No ASO-controlled rate-limiting occurs. ASO will attempt to communicate with Azure and
  #   kube-apiserver as much as needed based on load. It will back off based on throttling from
  #   either kube-apiserver or Azure, but will not artificially limit its throughput.
  # * bucket: Uses a token-bucket algorithm to rate-limit reconciliations. Note that this limits how often
  #   the operator performs a reconciliation, but not every reconciliation triggers a call to kube-apiserver
  #   or Azure (though many do). Since this controls reconciles it can be used to coarsely control throughput
  #   and CPU usage of the operator, as well as the number of requests that the operator issues to Azure.
  #   Keep in mind that the Azure throttling limits (defined at
  #   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/request-limits-and-throttling)
  #   differentiate between request types. Since a given reconcile for a resource may result in polling (a GET) or
  #   modification (a PUT) it's not possible to entirely avoid Azure throttling by tuning these bucket limits.
  #   We don't recommend enabling this mode by default.
  #   If enabling this mode, we strongly recommend doing some experimentation to tune these values to something to
