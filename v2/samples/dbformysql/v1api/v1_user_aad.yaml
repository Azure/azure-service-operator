    # alias is optional if the name of the user is less than 32 characters but required if it's longer
    # than 32 characters. Note that if alias is specified it is the name used to configure/control the user
    # via SQL commands, but the actual name you use to log into the Server with is the name specified in .spec.azureName.
    # For example if my azureName is "myuser@mydomain.onmicrosoft.com" and alias is "myuser", when logging in specify
    # username "myuser@mydomain.onmicrosoft.com".

    # The serverAdminUsername should match the login name of the server AAD administrator.
    # If the administrator was configured with ASO, that field is .spec.login on the FlexibleServersAdministrator type.
    # If the administrator is a group, the ServerAdminUsername should be the group name, not the actual username of the
    # identity to log in with. For example if the administrator group is "admin-group" and identity "my-identity" is
    # a member of that group, the ServerAdminUsername should be "admin-group"
