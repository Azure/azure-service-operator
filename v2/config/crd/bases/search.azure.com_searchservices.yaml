                  'deleting': The search service is being deleted. 'degraded': The search service is degraded. This can occur when the
                  underlying search units are not healthy. The search service is most likely operational, but performance might be slow
                  and some requests might be dropped. 'disabled': The search service is disabled. In this state, the service will reject

                  error states, it means the Azure Cognitive Search team is actively investigating the underlying issue. Dedicated
                  services in these states are still chargeable based on the number of search units provisioned.

                  completed. If you are using the free service, this value tends to come back as 'succeeded' directly in the call to
                  Create search service. This is because the free service uses capacity that is already set up.
