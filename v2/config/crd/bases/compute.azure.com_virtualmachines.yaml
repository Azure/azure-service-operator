                      -1 – indicates default price to be up-to on-demand.
                      You can set the maxPrice to -1 to indicate that the Azure Spot VM/VMSS should not be evicted for price reasons. Also,

                  Currently, a VM can only be added to availability set at creation time. The availability set to which the VM is being
                  added should be under the same resource group as the availability set resource. An existing VM cannot be added to an
                  availability set.

                      This price will be compared with the current Azure Spot price for the VM size. Also, the prices are compared at the time
                      of create/update of Azure Spot VM/VMSS and the operation will only succeed if  the maxPrice is greater than the current
                      Azure Spot price.
                      The maxPrice will also be used for evicting a Azure Spot VM/VMSS if the current Azure Spot price goes beyond the
                      maxPrice after creation of VM/VMSS.
                      Possible values are:
                      - Any decimal value greater than zero. Example: 0.01538
                      -1 – indicates default price to be up-to on-demand.
                      You can set the maxPrice to -1 to indicate that the Azure Spot VM/VMSS should not be evicted for price reasons. Also,
                      the default max price is -1 if it is not provided by you.

                            detachOption: ForceDetach is applicable only for managed data disks. If a previous detachment attempt of the data disk
                            did not complete due to an unexpected failure from the virtual machine and the disk is still not released then use
                            force-detach as a last resort option to detach the disk forcibly from the VM. All writes might not have been flushed

                            This feature is still in preview mode and is not supported for VirtualMachineScaleSet. To force-detach a data disk
                            update toBeDetached to 'true' along with setting detachOption: 'ForceDetach'.

                      You can set the maxPrice to -1 to indicate that the Azure Spot VM/VMSS should not be evicted for price reasons. Also,

                      Recommended way to get the list of available sizes is using these APIs:

                      set](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/compute/availabilitysets/listavailablesizes)

                      virtual machine sizes, see [Sizes for virtual machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/sizes).
                      The available VM sizes depend on region and availability set.

                            detachOption: ForceDetach is applicable only for managed data disks. If a previous detachment attempt of the data disk
