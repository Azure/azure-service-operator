                        DestinationExpression is a CEL expression and a destination to store the result in. The destination may
                        be a secret or a configmap. The value of the expression is stored at the specified location in
                        the destination.

                            Key is the key in the ConfigMap or Secret being written to. If the CEL expression in Value returns a string
                            this is required to identify what key to write to. If the CEL expression in Value returns a map[string]string
                            Key must not be set, instead the keys written will be determined dynamically based on the keys of the resulting
                            map[string]string.

                        DestinationExpression is a CEL expression and a destination to store the result in. The destination may
                        be a secret or a configmap. The value of the expression is stored at the specified location in
                        the destination.
