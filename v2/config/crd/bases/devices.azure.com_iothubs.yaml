                            Key is the key in the ConfigMap or Secret being written to. If the CEL expression in Value returns a string
                            this is required to identify what key to write to. If the CEL expression in Value returns a map[string]string
                            Key must not be set, instead the keys written will be determined dynamically based on the keys of the resulting
                            map[string]string.
