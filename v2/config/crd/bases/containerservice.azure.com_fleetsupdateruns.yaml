                  Defines the update sequence of the clusters via stages and groups.
                  Stages within a run are executed sequentially one
                  after another.
                  Groups within a stage are executed in parallel.
                  Member clusters within a group are updated sequentially
                  one after another.
                  A valid strategy contains no duplicate groups within or across stages.
