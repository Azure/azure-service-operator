                        DestinationExpression is a CEL expression and a destination to store the result in. The destination may
                        be a secret or a configmap. The value of the expression is stored at the specified location in
                        the destination.

                            this is required to identify what key to write to. If the CEL expression in Value returns a map[string]string
                            Key must not be set, instead the keys written will be determined dynamically based on the keys of the resulting
