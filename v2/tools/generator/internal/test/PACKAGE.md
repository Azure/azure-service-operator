# test

## Overview

The test package provides specialized testing utilities and helper functions for the Azure Service Operator code generator, making it easier to write comprehensive tests for generated code, type definitions, and code transformations.

**Type assertions**: The package includes robust utilities for asserting that generated type definitions match expected outputs, with support for golden file testing to validate code generation results and simplify test maintenance.

**Test fixtures**: Common test fixtures and factory functions for creating test resources, package references, and other elements needed in tests throughout the codebase, ensuring consistency in test data.

**Mock implementations**: Provides mock and fake implementations of various interfaces used in the code generator, such as FakeFunction, making it easier to test components in isolation.

**Test configuration**: Flexible assertion options pattern that allows test behavior to be customized with a fluent API, enabling test cases to be easily adapted to different scenarios.

## Testing

The package's own tests use standard Go testing with:

* Gomega for assertions to validate correctness of test utilities themselves
* Golden file testing to ensure consistent test output generation
* Meta-testing approach to validate that the testing tools themselves work correctly

Tests can be run using:

```bash
go test ./v2/tools/generator/internal/test/...
```

## Related packages

* **astmodel**: The test package works closely with astmodel to create test fixtures and validate generated types.
* **astbuilder**: Provides building blocks that test uses to create and manipulate AST nodes for testing.
* **codegen**: Benefits from test package utilities when testing pipeline stages and code generation.
* **testcases**: Depends on test utilities when implementing specific test case scenarios for property assignments, JSON serialization, and other features.
