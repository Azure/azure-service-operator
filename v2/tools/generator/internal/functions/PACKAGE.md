# Functions Package

The `functions` package provides function building blocks for generating methods and function implementations that are attached to Go types in the Azure Service Operator (ASO) code generator.

## Overview

The `functions` package contains the necessary components to generate Go functions and methods that implement various interfaces and behaviors required by the Kubernetes API machinery. It provides a foundational set of building blocks for crafting Go code that enables resource types to work with the Kubernetes ecosystem.

**Function generators** form the core of this package, providing specialized builders for creating different types of functions such as resource conversion, validation, and defaulting functions. These generators handle the complex task of creating conformant Go code with appropriate signatures, parameters, and return types.

**Interface implementations** are built by composing multiple functions together to satisfy specific Kubernetes interfaces. For example, the Kubernetes validation webhook interface requires multiple validation method implementations which this package can generate.

**Common patterns** are abstracted into reusable components. The package includes different base function types like `ObjectFunction`, `ResourceFunction`, and `DataFunction` that provide common behaviors while allowing specialization for specific use cases.

## Testing

The functions package is thoroughly tested using:

* Gomega for assertions in unit tests
* Golden file testing to verify that generated code matches expected output
* Property tests for complex function generators such as property assignments
* Interface implementation tests to ensure correct behavior against Kubernetes interfaces
