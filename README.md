# Azure Service Operator (for Kubernetes)

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/azure/azure-service-operator/_apis/build/status/Azure.azure-service-operator?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/azure/azure-service-operator/_build/latest?definitionId=36&branchName=master)

> This project is experimental. Expect the API to change. It is not recommended for production environments.

## Introduction

An Operator is an application-specific controller that extends the Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage instances of complex stateful applications on behalf of a Kubernetes user. It builds upon the basic Kubernetes resource and controller concepts but includes domain or application-specific knowledge to automate common tasks.

(For more details about operators, we recommend [Introducing Operators: Putting Operational Knowledge into Software](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operators.html)).

This repository contains the resources and code to provision and deprovision different Azure services using a Kubernetes operator.

The Azure Operator comprises of:

- The Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for each of the Azure services that the Kubernetes user can provision
- The Kubernetes controller that watches for requests to create Custom Resources for these CRDs and creates them

The project was built using [Kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/).
