The Azure Service Operator helps you provision Azure resources and connect your applications to them from within Kubernetes.

## Overview

The Azure Operator comprises of:

- The Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for each of the Azure services that the Kubernetes user can provision
- The Kubernetes controller that watches for requests to create Custom Resources for these CRDs and creates them

The project was built using [Kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/).
