# Azure Service Operator (for Kubernetes)

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/azure/azure-service-operator/_apis/build/status/Azure.azure-service-operator?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/azure/azure-service-operator/_build/latest?definitionId=36&branchName=master)

> Note: The API is expected to change (while adhering to semantic versioning). Alpha and Beta resources are generally not recommended for production environments.

The **Azure Service Operator** helps you provision Azure resources and connect your applications to them from within Kubernetes.

## Overview

The Azure Service Operator comprises of:

- The Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for each of the Azure services a Kubernetes user can provision.
- The Kubernetes controller that watches for requests to create Custom Resources for each of these CRDs and creates them.

The project was built using [Kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/).

## Quickstart

![Deploying ASO](/docs/images/asodeploy.gif)

Ready to quickly deploy the latest version of Azure Service Operator on your Kubernetes cluster and start exploring? Follow these steps.

0. Before starting, you must have a Kubernetes cluster (at least version 1.16) [created and running](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/create-cluster/). Check your connection and version with:

   ```console
   $ kubectl version
   Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"19", GitVersion:"v1.19.2", GitCommit:"f5743093fd1c663cb0cbc89748f730662345d44d", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2020-09-16T13:41:02Z", GoVersion:"go1.15", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
   Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"18", GitVersion:"v1.18.2", GitCommit:"52c56ce7a8272c798dbc29846288d7cd9fbae032", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2020-04-30T20:19:45Z", GoVersion:"go1.13.9", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
    ```

1. Install [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/) on the cluster using the following command.

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.12.0/cert-manager.yaml
    ```
2.  Install [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/), and add the Helm repo for Azure Service Operator. Please note that the instructions here use Helm 3.

    ```sh
    helm repo add azureserviceoperator https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/master/charts
    ```
3. Create an Azure Service Principal. You'll need this to grant Azure Service Operator permissions to create resources in your subscription.
   For more information about other forms of authentication supported by ASO, see [the authentication section of the deployment documentation](./docs/howto/deploy.md#Authentication). 

    First, set the following environment variables to your Azure Tenant ID and Subscription ID with your values:
    ```yaml
    AZURE_TENANT_ID=<your-tenant-id-goes-here>
    AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<your-subscription-id-goes-here>
    ```

    You can find these values by using the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest):
    ```sh
    az account show
    ```
    Next, we'll create a service principal with Contributor permissions for your subscription, so ASO can create resources in your subscription on your behalf. Note that the [ServicePrincipal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli) you pass to the command below needs to have access to create resources in your subscription. If you'd like to use Managed Identity for authorization instead, check out instructions [here](docs/howto/managedidentity.md).

    ```sh
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "azure-service-operator" --role contributor \
        --scopes /subscriptions/$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
    ```

    This should give you output like the following:
    ```sh
    "appId": "xxxxxxxxxx",
    "displayName": "azure-service-operator",
    "name": "http://azure-service-operator",
    "password": "xxxxxxxxxxx",
    "tenant": "xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    ```

    Once you have created a service principal, set the following variables to your app ID and password values:
    ```sh 
    AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id> # This is the appID from the service principal we created.
    AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret> # This is the password from the service principal we created.
    ```

4. Install the Azure Service Operator on your cluster using the following helm install command.

    ```sh
    helm upgrade --install aso https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/raw/master/charts/azure-service-operator-0.1.0.tgz \
            --create-namespace \
            --namespace=azureoperator-system \
            --set azureSubscriptionID=$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID \
            --set azureTenantID=$AZURE_TENANT_ID \
            --set azureClientID=$AZURE_CLIENT_ID \
            --set azureClientSecret=$AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET \
            --set image.repository="mcr.microsoft.com/k8s/azureserviceoperator:latest"
    ```

    You should now see the Azure service operator pods running in your cluster, like the below.

    ```console
    $ kubectl get pods -n azureoperator-system
    NAME                                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    azureoperator-controller-manager-7dd75bbd97-mk4s9   2/2     Running   0          35s
    ```

To deploy an Azure service through the operator, check out the set of [supported Azure services](#supported-azure-services) and the sample YAML files in the `config/samples` [folder](config/samples) to create the resources using the following command.

```sh
kubectl apply -f <YAML file>
```
